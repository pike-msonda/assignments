This data set contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, 
spanning 90 degrees for mines and 180 degrees for rocks. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0, 
where each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. 
The output attribute contains the letter "R" if the object is a rock and "M" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).
